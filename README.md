This is my resume/portfolio website.
I had a lot of fun learning HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript to create and customize this website out of a freely available template.
Hopefully, this small project will help me reach out to a wider audience.
My goal was mainly to be able to showcase my professional profile along with my coding projects.
